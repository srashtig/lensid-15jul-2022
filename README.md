# Strong Lensing ML

This project aims to classify the pair of gravitational wave signals as lensed or unlensed using machine learning, in low latency.
The input is Q-transforms and bayestar skymaps which are generated in less than a minute.
 
**Note: GIT-LFS required to clone the repository.** 
Kindly follow the **[installation instructions](https://git.ligo.org/srashti.goyal/strong-lensing-ml/-/wikis/Installation-instructions)** page for the same. 

Visit **[code review](https://git.ligo.org/srashti.goyal/strong-lensing-ml/-/wikis/Code-Review)** page for the details of various scripts/notebooks.

PS: The input qtransforms, skymaps for the simulated and real events are on the Alice@ICTS used for training and testing. Nevertheless, the dataframes are available which contain the derieved features that are input the ML.
